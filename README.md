# FizzBuzz with FsCheck

## Introduction

You all know the famous FizzBuzz coding kata:

Your task is write a function that - given a positive number n 
* returns "FizzBuzz" for multiples of 15
* returns "Fizz" for multiples of 3
* returns "Buzz" for multiples of 5
* returns the n converted into a string in any other case

The purpose of this project is just to demonstrate how to do this using FsCheck
instead of common unit-tests.
